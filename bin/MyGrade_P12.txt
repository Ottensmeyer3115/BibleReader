My Self-evaluation: Fred Ottensmeyer and Brandon Maurice
-----------------------
Time spent:    7 hours
-----------------------
Expected Grade: 90/100%
-----------------------
Justification:  We ran the JUnit tests and was able to get everything working properly.  Not only that, but we were able to improve the run time of a few tests.
  So I was able to spend some extra time better implementing my tree map.

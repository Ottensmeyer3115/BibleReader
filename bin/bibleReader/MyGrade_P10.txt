My Self-evaluation: Fred Ottensmeyer
-----------------------
Time spent:    6 hours
-----------------------
Expected Grade: 90/100%
-----------------------
Justification:  I ran the JUnit tests and was able to get everything working properly.   I'm extremely tired because these tests took some time.  But I definately put in a solid effort.  I'm sure theres still some problems I missed.
